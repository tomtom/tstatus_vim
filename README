This plugin provides a still rather simple statusline manager to monitor 
options and variables. If an option's or variable's value changes, it is 
displayed in the statusline.

In order to monitor options/variables, either set |g:tstatus_names| in 
|vimrc| or call |:TStatusregister|.

Call |:TStatus| to set or reset the status line or the ruler.
